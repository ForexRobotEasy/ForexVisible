# ForexVisible Expert Advisor ReadMe

ForexVisible Expert Advisor is a trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This Expert Advisor allows you to copy trading signals from a signal terminal and place trades based on those signals. It also includes a utility to monitor and close positions based on the minimum profit percentage set by the user.

## Global variables and constants

- `signalTerminal`: The signal terminal to subscribe to (default: 1)
- `currencyPair1`: The first currency pair to copy signals from (default: 'EURUSD')
- `currencyPair2`: The second currency pair to copy signals from (default: 'GBPUSD')
- `currencyPair3`: The third currency pair to copy signals from (default: 'USDJPY')
- `minimumProfitPercentage`: The minimum profit percentage to close all positions (default: 5.0)

## Expert initialization function

The `OnInit` function is called when the Expert Advisor is initialized. In this function, the Expert Advisor subscribes to the signal terminal using the `CopySignal` function.

## Expert deinitialization function

The `OnDeinit` function is called when the Expert Advisor is deinitialized. In this function, the Expert Advisor unsubscribes from the signal terminal using the `UnsubscribeSignal` function.

## Expert tick function

The `OnTick` function is called on every tick. This function checks if there are any open positions and calculates the profit percentage. If the profit percentage is greater than or equal to the minimum profit percentage, all positions are closed using the `CloseAllPositions` function.

## Copy signal from the signal terminal

The `CopySignal` function copies trading functions from the signal terminal to the current terminal. It uses the `CopyRates` function to copy the rates of the current symbol and period from the signal terminal. Once the rates are copied, the `PlaceTrades` function is called to place trades based on the received signals.

## Unsubscribe from the signal terminal

The `UnsubscribeSignal` function is used to unsubscribe from the signal terminal. This function should contain the code for unsubscribing from the signal terminal, but it is not implemented in this code sample.

## Place trades based on signals

The `PlaceTrades` function is called when trades need to be placed based on the signals received. This function should contain the code for placing trades based on the signals, but it is not implemented in this code sample.

## Close all positions

The `CloseAllPositions` function is called to close all open positions. This function should contain the code for closing all positions, but it is not implemented in this code sample.
